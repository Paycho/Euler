Euler
=====

This is the code for my solutions to all of the problems I've completed so far from projecteuler.net

Although I've tried wherever possible to make things nice and pretty, there are some very crufty spots still, lots
of ugly java-isms, and probably places where I'm doing dumb things.


Installation
====

git clone https://github.com/Paycho/Euler.git

If you're using IntelliJ or another Java IDE, just add all the .jar files included to your project, add everything under
Euler/src to your project root, build, and run EulerMain. The code uses features from Java 8, so be mindful of that 
when you're configuring your project.

If you're UI-averse, a simple Makefile has been graciously provided by JoeDrago:

git clone https://github.com/Paycho/Euler.git

cd Euler

make all

make run
